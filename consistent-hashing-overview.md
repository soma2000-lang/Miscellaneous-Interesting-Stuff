# Consistent Hashing

Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table. It allows for efficient scaling of distributed caching systems and databases.

## Key Concepts

1. Hash ring: Imagine a circular ring where both data items and nodes (servers) are mapped.
2. Hash function: Used to map both data and nodes to positions on the ring.
3. Data assignment: Each data item is assigned to the nearest node clockwise on the ring.

## Advantages

- Minimizes reorganization when nodes are added or removed
- Allows for easy scaling of distributed systems
- Provides better load balancing

## Use Cases in Big Tech Companies

1. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
   - Companies like Akamai use consistent hashing to distribute content across their global network of servers.
   - Ensures efficient content routing and load balancing.

2. **Distributed Caching**
   - Amazon's Dynamo DB uses consistent hashing for distributing data across nodes.
   - Memcached and Redis often employ consistent hashing in their client-side sharding mechanisms.

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Google's load balancers use consistent hashing to distribute requests across backend servers.
   - Ensures minimal disruption when adding or removing servers.

4. **Distributed Databases**
   - Apache Cassandra uses consistent hashing for data partitioning across nodes.
   - Helps in achieving horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.

5. **Distributed File Systems**
   - Systems like HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) use consistent hashing for data block placement.
   - Ensures even distribution of data across multiple nodes.

6. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Used in service discovery and request routing in microservices deployments.
   - Helps in efficiently managing and scaling microservices.

7. **Peer-to-Peer Networks**
   - BitTorrent-like systems use consistent hashing to determine which peers are responsible for which pieces of data.

By employing consistent hashing, these companies can build highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient distributed systems that can handle massive amounts of data and traffic.
